/*Transitions can be used to control animation speed when changing from an original state of code to when a property is applied. Different states may be defined using pseudo-classes like :hover or :active or dynamically set using JavaScript.*/

/*Transitions work by  breaking down the transition into time intervals that follow an accelerated code*/
